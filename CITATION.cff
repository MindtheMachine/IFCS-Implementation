abstract: >
  Complete implementation of the ECR-Control Probe-IFCS trilogy for
  inference-time governance in Large Language Models. Includes Evaluative
  Coherence Regulation (ECR) for candidate selection, Control Probe (Type-1
  and Type-2) for admissibility gating and interaction monitoring, and
  Inference-Time Commitment Shaping (IFCS) for commitment strength regulation.
