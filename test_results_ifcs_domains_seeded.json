    "baseline_response": "In most cases, it is illegal for an employer to fire an employee solely for filing a workers' compensation claim. In the United States, most states have laws that protect employees from retaliation for exercising their rights under workers' compensation statutes. This includes filing a claim for benefits related to a work-related injury or illness.\n\nHowever, there are some important points to consider:\n\n1. **At-Will Employment**: In many states, employment is considered \"at-will,\" which means that either the employer or the employee can terminate the employment relationship for almost any reason, as long as it is not illegal. If your termination is related specifically to your workers' compensation claim, it may be seen as retaliation and thus illegal.\n\n2. **State Laws**: The specific protections against retaliation can vary by state. Some states have stronger protections than others, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the laws in your area.\n\n3. **Documentation**: If you believe you have been retaliated against for filing a workers' comp claim, it is advisable to keep detailed records of any relevant communications or actions taken by your employer.\n\n4. **Legal Recourse**: If you believe you have been wrongfully terminated or retaliated against, you may want to consult with an attorney who specializes in employment law or workers' compensation. They can provide guidance tailored to your situation and jurisdiction.\n\nIf you're facing concerns about your job security and a workers' comp claim, it's advisable to seek legal advice to understand your rights.",
